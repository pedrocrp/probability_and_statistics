# Statistics and Probability Projects
This repository is dedicated to projects that explore fundamental concepts of statistics and probability. Here you'll find a variety of projects, all with the intention of providing a deeper understanding of statistical and probabilistic theories through hands-on practice.

# Contents
The projects contained in this repository cover a range of topics, including but not limited to:

- Bayes' Theorem: Projects demonstrating the practical application of Bayes' Theorem in classification problems, statistical inference, and more.

- Law of Large Numbers: Projects illustrating the Law of Large Numbers in real-world situations, explaining the tendency of a particular outcome to occur in a repeated experiment.

- And many other relevant topics like probability distributions, hypothesis testing, linear regression, etc.

# Goal
The goal of this repository is to provide an educational resource for those wishing to learn or enhance their knowledge in statistics and probability. It can be useful for students, teachers, data scientists, researchers, or anyone interested in understanding the math behind the numbers. In addition, I want to show the topics that I have studied during my career.

# Usage
Each project in this repository is stand-alone, meaning you can pick a topic of your interest and start from there. Each project contains a detailed README explaining the aim of the project, the concepts used, as well as a step-by-step guide on how to execute the project.
