# Large Numbers Law Simulation Project
## Project Description
This project aims to provide a practical demonstration of the Law of Large Numbers through a coin-tossing simulation. The Law of Large Numbers is a fundamental rule in probability theory that describes the result of performing the same experiment a large number of times. According to this law, as an experiment is repeated, the average of the results should get closer to the expected value.

Our simulation performs multiple coin-tossing experiments, increasing the number of tosses with each experiment. Each experiment configuration is repeated a fixed number of times. The results are then visualized in a plot, showing how the average result approaches the expected value as the number of coin tosses per experiment increases.

## Code
The code for this project is written in Python and uses the NumPy and Matplotlib libraries. NumPy is used for random number generation and numerical computations, while Matplotlib is used for visualizing the results.

The code performs the following sequence of operations:

1. Generates a series of coin tosses for an increasing number of tosses per experiment.
2. Computes the average of the results for each experiment.
3. Plots the average results as a function of the number of tosses per experiment.

The resulting plot illustrates the convergence of the average results to the expected value as the number of tosses increases, demonstrating the Law of Large Numbers.

## Requirements
The following Python packages are required to run this project:

- NumPy
- Matplotlib

These packages can be installed using Python's pip package manager:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
## Usage
To use this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Ensure that the NumPy and Matplotlib packages are installed.
3. Run the Python script. This will generate an image of the resulting plot.
4. Open the image of the plot to view the Law of Large Numbers visualization.

This project serves as a simple demonstration of the Law of Large Numbers and can be extended or adapted for other purposes, such as part of a statistics or probability course, or as a teaching tool.
